## Products Module API Documentation

### Module Overview

The **Products Module** provides a robust and straightforward API for interacting with product data. It serves as the primary interface for retrieving information about products available within the system.

*   **What it does:** This module is responsible for managing and exposing product-related data. Currently, its core function is to allow clients to fetch a list of all available products.
*   **Business Context & Use Cases:**
    *   **E-commerce Platforms:** Displaying product catalogs, search results, and category listings to customers.
    *   **Inventory Management:** Providing a read-only view of current product offerings for internal systems.
    *   **Content Management Systems:** Populating dynamic content related to products on websites or applications.
    *   **Reporting & Analytics:** Gathering product data for business intelligence and sales analysis.
*   **Key Features & Capabilities:**
    *   Retrieving a comprehensive list of all products.
    *   Standardized `Product` data model including `id`, `name`, and `price`.
    *   Designed for easy integration with front-end applications and other microservices.

### Endpoint Documentation

This section details the available API endpoints within the Products module.

#### 1. Get All Products

Retrieves a list of all products available in the system.

*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Path:** `/products`
*   **Summary:** Get all products
*   **Description:** This endpoint allows clients to fetch a complete catalog of products. The response includes an array of `Product` objects, each containing essential details like a unique identifier, name, and price.
*   **Authentication:** *No specific authentication is indicated in the OpenAPI specification for this endpoint. Consult your API's security guidelines for actual requirements.*
*   **Parameters:** None

*   **Responses:**

    *   **`200 OK` - List of products**
        *   **Description:** Successfully retrieved the list of products.
        *   **Content Type:** `application/json`
        *   **Schema:** `Array<Product>`
        *   **Example Response:**
            ```json
            [
              {
                "id": "prod_001",
                "name": "Laptop Pro 15",
                "price": 1299.99
              },
              {
                "id": "prod_002",
                "name": "Wireless Mouse X",
                "price": 49.99
              },
              {
                "id": "prod_003",
                "name": "Mechanical Keyboard K2",
                "price": 99.00
              }
            ]
            ```

*   **Error Handling:**
    *   While the OpenAPI specification only defines a successful `200` response for this endpoint, real-world API integrations should anticipate and handle potential errors:
        *   `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server while processing the request.
        *   `401 Unauthorized`: (If authentication were implemented) The request lacks valid authentication credentials.
        *   `403 Forbidden`: (If authorization were implemented) The authenticated user does not have permission to access this resource.

### Code Examples

This section provides working code examples for interacting with the Products API.

#### cURL Example

Use this command-line example to test the endpoint. Replace `http://localhost:3000` with your API's base URL.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/products" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
```

#### TypeScript/JavaScript Example (using `fetch`)

This example demonstrates how to fetch products using the browser's native `fetch` API.

```typescript
// Define the Product interface based on the data model
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

// Assuming your API is running locally on port 3000
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';

async function fetchAllProducts(): Promise<Product[]> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/products`, {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        // 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' // Uncomment and replace if authentication is required
      },
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      // Attempt to parse error message from response body
      const errorDetail = await response.json().catch(() => ({ message: 'No additional error details.' }));
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}, Message: ${errorDetail.message || response.statusText}`);
    }

    const products: Product[] = await response.json();
    console.log('Successfully fetched products:', products);
    return products;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch products:', error);
    // Re-throw or handle the error appropriately for your application
    throw error;
  }
}

// Example usage:
(async () => {
  try {
    const products = await fetchAllProducts();
    console.log(`Found ${products.length} products.`);
    // You can now render or process the products array
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Application failed to load products:', error);
  }
})();
```

#### Integration Patterns

*   **Client-Side Data Loading:** For web applications, products can be fetched on component mount (e.g., using `useEffect` in React or `onMounted` in Vue) to display product listings.
*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** For improved performance and SEO, product data can be fetched on the server during the build process or request time, then pre-rendered into the HTML.
*   **Error Handling:** Always implement robust error handling. Wrap API calls in `try...catch` blocks, check `response.ok`, and provide meaningful feedback to the user or log errors for debugging.
*   **Data Caching:** For frequently accessed product listings, consider implementing caching strategies (e.g., browser cache, CDN, server-side cache like Redis) to reduce API calls and improve load times.
*   **Scalability Considerations:** While the current endpoint is simple, for very large product catalogs, consider future enhancements such as pagination, filtering, and search capabilities to optimize performance and user experience.

### Data Models

This section describes the data structures (schemas) used by the Products module.

#### `Product`

Represents a single product within the system.

*   **Type:** `object`
*   **Description:** Defines the structure of a product entity returned by the API.
*   **Properties:**

    | Property  | Type     | Description                               | Required | Validation Rules       | Example Value  |
    | :-------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------- | :------------- |
    | `id`      | `string` | A unique identifier for the product.      | Yes      | Must be a string.      | `"prod_001"`   |
    | `name`    | `string` | The name or title of the product.         | Yes      | Must be a string.      | `"Laptop Pro"` |
    | `price`   | `number` | The selling price of the product.         | Yes      | Must be a number.      | `1299.99`      |

*   **TypeScript Interface:**

    ```typescript
    interface Product {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      price: number;
    }
    ```

*   **Example Payload (for an individual Product object):**

    ```json
    {
      "id": "prod_001",
      "name": "Laptop Pro 15",
      "price": 1299.99
    }
    ```
