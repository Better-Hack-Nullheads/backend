# API Documentation

<Info>
  This document provides comprehensive API reference for interacting with our backend services.
  It covers various endpoints for managing products and users, including creation, retrieval,
  updates, and deletion.
</Info>

## Overview

This API provides a robust set of endpoints for managing `Products` and `Users` within the system. It's built using the NestJS framework, leveraging its modular architecture and dependency injection patterns. Consumers can interact with product catalogs and user directories, performing standard CRUD operations and specific actions like user deactivation/activation or searching users by email.

<Note>
  All timestamps in request/response bodies are expected/returned in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`).
</Note>

## Framework Information

This API is developed using **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.

### Key NestJS Patterns & Conventions

*   **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and return responses. They define the endpoint paths and HTTP methods.
*   **Services**: Encapsulate business logic and data persistence operations, injected into controllers.
*   **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Define the shape of data for requests (e.g., `CreateProductDto`, `UpdateUserDto`) and responses, ensuring data validation and consistency.
*   **Decorators**: NestJS heavily uses TypeScript decorators (e.g., `@Controller()`, `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Body()`, `@Param()`, `@Query()`) to define metadata and handle request parsing.
*   **Middleware**: While not explicitly shown in the route analysis, NestJS supports Express-style middleware for tasks like logging, authentication, or data manipulation before requests reach the route handlers.

### Framework-Specific Features

*   **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected into controllers, promoting modularity and testability.
*   **Built-in Validation**: NestJS integrates well with class-validator for DTO validation.
*   **Modular Structure**: The application is organized into modules (e.g., `ProductsModule`, `UsersModule`) for better scalability and maintainability.

## Authentication

All protected endpoints require authentication using a **Bearer Token**. This token should be included in the `Authorization` header of every request.

<Auth type="Bearer" />

### Required Headers

| Header          | Type     | Required | Description                                     |
| :-------------- | :------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `Authorization` | `string` | Yes      | `Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`                    |
| `Content-Type`  | `string` | Yes      | `application/json` (for requests with a body)   |

### Permission Roles

Some operations may be restricted based on the authenticated user's `role`. For example, only users with `admin` or `manager` roles might be able to create or update certain resources. The `User` model includes a `role` field for this purpose.

<Note>
  Specific role-based access control (RBAC) details are implemented at the application level
  and may vary. Refer to your administrator for specific permissions.
