# Products API Module Documentation

## 1. Module Overview

The **Products API Module** is responsible for managing and providing access to product-related information within the system. It serves as the primary interface for retrieving details about available products.

### 1.1. Clear Description
This module exposes endpoints to interact with the product catalog. Currently, its primary function is to allow consumers to fetch a list of all products stored in the system.

### 1.2. Business Context and Use Cases
The Products module is a core component for any system dealing with items or services for sale. Its common use cases include:

*   **E-commerce Frontends:** Displaying product listings, search results, and category pages to customers.
*   **Inventory Management Systems:** Providing a read-only view of products for inventory reconciliation, stock-taking, or reporting.
*   **Recommendation Engines:** Fetching product attributes to generate personalized recommendations for users.
*   **Catalog Synchronization:** Supplying product data to external platforms, marketplaces, or internal analytics services.
*   **Internal Tools:** Powering administrative interfaces where staff can view and manage product details.

### 1.3. Key Features and Capabilities
The current version of the Products module offers the following key capability:

*   **Retrieve All Products:** Fetch a complete list of all products, including their unique identifiers, names, and prices.

## 2. Endpoint Documentation

This section details the available API endpoints within the Products module.

### 2.1. `GET /products` - Get All Products

*   **Summary:** Retrieves a comprehensive list of all products available in the system.
*   **Description:** This endpoint allows clients to fetch an array of `Product` objects. Each object provides essential details about a product, such as its unique ID, name, and current price. This is typically used to display a product catalog or for data synchronization purposes.
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Path:** `/products`
*   **Tags:** `products`

#### 2.1.1. Parameters
This endpoint does not require any path, query, or header parameters.

#### 2.1.2. Responses

*   **`200 OK`**
    *   **Description:** A successful response returning an array of product objects.
    *   **Content Type:** `application/json`
    *   **Schema:** `Array<Product>`
    *   **Example Response:**
        ```json
        [
          {
            "id": "prod_001",
            "name": "Laptop Pro 15",
            "price": 1299.99
          },
          {
            "id": "prod_002",
            "name": "Mechanical Keyboard RGB",
            "price": 89.99
          },
          {
            "id": "prod_003",
            "name": "Wireless Ergonomic Mouse",
            "price": 45.00
          }
        ]
        ```

#### 2.1.3. Error Handling
While not explicitly defined in the provided OpenAPI spec for this endpoint, common API error responses you might encounter include:

*   **`400 Bad Request`**: (Future potential) If the endpoint were to accept query parameters and they were malformed or invalid.
*   **`401 Unauthorized`**: If authentication/authorization is implemented and the request lacks valid credentials.
*   **`500 Internal Server Error`**: Indicates an unexpected issue on the server side. This typically points to a bug or an unhandled exception.

## 3. Code Examples

This section provides practical examples for interacting with the Products API using common tools and programming languages.

### 3.1. `GET /products`

#### 3.1.1. cURL Example
A simple command-line example to retrieve all products.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/products" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
```

#### 3.1.2. TypeScript/JavaScript Example (using `fetch`)
An asynchronous function to fetch and log all products.

```typescript
/**
 * Fetches all products from the API.
 * @returns {Promise<Product[]>} A promise that resolves to an array of products.
 * @throws {Error} If the network request fails or the server returns an error.
 */
async function getAllProducts(): Promise<Product[]> {
  const apiUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/products'; // Replace with your API base URL

  try {
    const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      // Attempt to parse error details from the response
      const errorDetail = await response.json().catch(() => ({ message: response.statusText }));
      console.error(`Error fetching products: ${response.status}`, errorDetail);
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}, Message: ${errorDetail.message || 'Unknown error'}`);
    }

    const products: Product[] = await response.json();
    console.log('Successfully fetched products:', products);
    return products;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch products:', error);
    // Re-throw to allow calling code to handle it
    throw error;
  }
}

// Example usage:
getAllProducts()
  .then(products => {
    if (products.length > 0) {
      console.log(`First product name: ${products[0].name}`);
    } else {
      console.log('No products found.');
    }
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('Operation to get all products failed:', err.message);
  });

// Define the Product interface for TypeScript type safety
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}
```

#### 3.1.3. Integration Patterns
*   **Web Applications (Frontend):**
    *   Call `GET /products` on initial page load of a product catalog view.
    *   Integrate with search functionality to filter the client-side product list or to fetch filtered results from a more advanced search endpoint (if available).
*   **Backend Services (Microservices):**
    *   An "Order Service" might call this endpoint to validate product existence and retrieve price details when processing a new order.
    *   A "Reporting Service" could periodically pull all product data for analytics and dashboard generation.
*   **Data Synchronization:**
    *   Used by ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to pull product data into a data warehouse.
    *   Synchronize product information with third-party systems like CRM, ERP, or marketing platforms.

### 4.1. `Product`

The `Product` model represents a single item available for sale or display in the system.

*   **Description:** Represents a unique product with its core identifying and commercial attributes.
*   **Type:** `object`

#### 4.1.1. Type Definition (TypeScript)
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;      // Unique identifier for the product
  name: string;    // The name of the product
  price: number;   // The price of the product
}
```

#### 4.1.2. JSON Schema
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Unique identifier for the product."
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The name of the product."
    },
    "price": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "The price of the product."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "id",
    "name",
    "price"
  ]
}
```

#### 4.1.3. Validation Rules
*   **`id`**:
    *   **Type:** `string`
    *   **Required:** Yes
    *   **Description:** A unique string that identifies the product.
*   **`name`**:
    *   **Type:** `string`
    *   **Required:** Yes
