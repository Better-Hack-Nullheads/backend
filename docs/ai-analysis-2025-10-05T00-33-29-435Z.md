# Project Analysis & Product Management API

<Info>
  This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the Project Analysis & Product Management API, built with NestJS. It covers endpoints for initiating and retrieving project analysis results, as well as a full CRUD interface for managing products.
</Info>

This API serves as the backend for managing product data and performing project-level analysis. It provides structured endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete product records, alongside functionality to trigger and fetch the status of project analysis tasks.

## Framework Information

This API is built using **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. NestJS leverages TypeScript and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

<Note>
  NestJS applications are structured around modules, controllers, and services.
  - **Controllers** handle incoming requests and return responses.
  - **Services** encapsulate business logic and data manipulation.
  - **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** are used to define the shape of request bodies and response payloads, ensuring strong typing and validation.
</Note>

**Key NestJS Conventions Used:**
- **Decorators:** `@Controller()`, `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Patch()`, `@Delete()`, `@Param()`, `@Body()` are extensively used for routing and parameter extraction.
- **Dependency Injection:** Services are injected into controllers, promoting modularity and testability.
- **Pipes:** Used for request validation and transformation (e.g., `ValidationPipe`).
- **Guards:** For authentication and authorization logic.

## Authentication

This API uses **Bearer Token** authentication. A valid JSON Web Token (JWT) must be provided in the `Authorization` header for all protected endpoints.

<Auth type="Bearer" />

**Required Headers:**

| Header        | Type   | Description                                 |
| :------------ | :----- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `Authorization` | `string` | **Required.** Bearer token (e.g., `Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>`). |

<Warning>
  Failure to provide a valid token for protected routes will result in a `401 Unauthorized` response.
</Warning>
